The sales leads API allows CO to notify SP about sales leads made by end customer. The end customer will select a
service they want to order, as well as provide personal and billing information, and click to order. The CO will then
send the order to SP, and the SP will either accept or deny the sales lead followed by creating an order to provision
the service at requested date and time. If the order is denied, CO is able to present to end customer what went wrong.

# Responses

All error handling should be using status codes from HTTP, if possible with the free text field "cause" stating what
went wrong. If the server has an ID of the error (such as a fault number or, even better, a ticket ID) it should be
included in the cause field.

Example:

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json

{ "cause": "Unknown service: 'INTERNET'" }
```

Example 2:

```http
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
Content-Type: application/json

{ "cause": "An Unknown error has occured. Error number 12345" }
```
