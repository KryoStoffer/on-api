# Availability API

Availability is used to query a single access. It returns the same information as the Feasibility, but also adds information about active services and evaluates if services can actually be delivered at current time. It is typically used prior to ordering to ensure a service can be activated.

### Example

Request:
```http
GET /api/2.3/accesses/STTA0001 HTTP/1.1
```

Response:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

## Data fields

This list shows additional fields and differences in the description of a field in the Availability, which are not already described in the <a href="feasibility.md">Feasibility</a>.

* `null` is not a valid value for any field
* Mandatory fields cannot be empty string ("")
